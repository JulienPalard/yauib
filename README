yauib -- Yet Another Useless IRC Bot

This bot is a pretty simple for developers

It's usage is as basic as :

Step 1, Fetch it :
$ git clone git://github.com/JulienPalard/yauib.git

Step 2, cd into it :
$ cd yauib

Step 3, launch it, a bit verbose :
$ ./ircbot.py -vv connect 'irc.server.example.com' '#your_channel' 'your_bot_login'

Or check usages ...
$ ./ircbot.py
usage: ircbot.py [-h] [-v] [-vv] [-vvv] [-q] {say,connect} ...
ircbot.py: error: too few arguments

$ ./ircbot.py connect
usage: ircbot.py connect [-h] [-p LOCAL_PORT] [-d] [-k KEY]
                         server chan nickname
ircbot.py connect: error: too few arguments

Step 4, Open another terminal / console / screen / tmux ...

Step 5, Use your bot to say hello to your friends :
$ ./ircbot.py say 'Hello !'

Step 6, Take a look at the logs :
The line :
2011-03-19 14:23:16 INFO calling: ['hooks/pubmsg', 'jul1en', '~mandark@example.com', '#chan', '', 'Hi']
give the INFOrmation that the bot is calling the executable hooks/pubmsg with the parameters 'jul1en' etc, etc...

Step 7, Look at the shell script hooks/pubmsg
And start coding yours !
See that the basic script in hooks/pubmsg tries to find another executable, in
the folder commands, named as the first word of what people says on the channel
So if someone says hello world !
the hooks/pubmsg will try to call commands/hello with the parameter 'world !'

Enjoy creating new hooks / commands, using your favorite language !
