yauib -- Yet Another Useless IRC Bot

Introduction
============

This bot is designed to be simple for developers.

Dependencies
============

There's only one dependency, irclib :
  On debian, aptitude install python-irclib
  Or easy_install python-irclib
  Or DL it from sourceforge http://sourceforge.net/projects/python-irclib/

How it works ?
==============

YAUIB is a very basic bot that, for each event received from IRC will call a
hook in the directory hooks-enabled/

So when a public message is received, the hook hooks-enabled/pubmsg is called.

There is a directory to store every hooks, that is hooks-available so you
should enable only some needed, creating symlinks in the directory
hooks-enabled.

There is a usefull default hook I wrote for you, it's named 'command'.
It executes commands that it find in the directory commands-enabled
so you have to create some symlinks from the directory commands-available
where I stored the commands I wrote.

Quick Start
===========

 * Fetch it
    $ git clone git://github.com/JulienPalard/yauib.git && cd yauib

 * launch it as a daemon ( -d )
    $ ./ircbot.py -d connect 'irc.server.example.com' '#your_channel' 'your_bot_login'
    Now your bot should appear on your channel.

 * Select one basic hook
    Now it's the time to hook some events, let's bind the 'command' hook to
    public messages :
    $ ( cd hooks-enabled && ln -s ../hooks-available/command pubmsg )

    The 'command' hook tries to call executables in the directory
    'commands-enabled' for everything said on the channel with the first word
    as executable name, and other as arguments, so the next step is to choose
    some commands :

 * Select some basic commands
    Let's test them all ... you'll choose later :X
    $ ( cd commands-enabled && for command in ../commands-available/*; do ln -s "$command"; done )

 * Now try your bot saying 'say hello' on the channel :
     The bot will run 'hooks-enabled/pubmsg' that is 'hooks-available/command'
     hooks-available/commands receiving 'say hello' will call
     commands-enabled/say hello
     say is, basically a shell script with 'echo $*'
     So it will echo hello, that will be wrote by the bot on the channel.

Writing you own hooks
=====================

Possible hook points are listed in the file hooks-available/hookpoints
A hook is given some parameters :
sender_login, sender_host, target_login, target_host, message [, message[, ...]]

So a very basic 'parrot' hook should be :
#!/bin/sh
shift 4 # Drop sender login and host, target login and host
printf "%s\n" "$*"

Writing you own commands for the command hook
=============================================

A given hook is 'hooks-available/command' that, receiving foo bar baz
calls commands-enabled/foo with bar and baz as arguments.

So if you have enabled this hook, you can write you own commands.
A command is an executable, so it can be written in ANY language,
it receives what people say as arguments, and the bot will say
everything the commands write it its stdout.

So a basic command writing a calendar on the channel should be named cal,
and contain :

#!/bin/sh
cal

Is there another way to make the bot speak ?
============================================

Yes, the bot is listening on a local port, by default 6668.
Everything received on this port is wrote back to the channel.
So a simple :
$ echo foo | netcat localhost 6668
will do the trick, but you should also try :
# ./ircbot.py say foo
That does the same !

With this feature you can push messages from cron, webpages or everything else.

Conclusion
==========

Enjoy creating new hooks / commands, using your favorite language !
