# To use this module you should have bti installed (aptitude install bti if
# you're on Debian, else, ... dunno ...)
#
# To let this module work you have to configure bti :
# 1) Just create a file bti.conf in the directory conf/ near to hooks/
# 2) GOTO http://twitter.com/apps/new and create an app
#    -> Give write rights
#    -> Set 'Application type' to 'Client'
# 2') Double and triple check, AFTER having created the application but BEFORE
#     step 3, in https://dev.twitter.com/apps that WRITE permissin is given to
#     you app (I checked it in step 2 but twitter forgot it ... so double check)
# 3) Copy the consumer_key and consumer_secret in bti.conf like :
#    consumer_key=ASDFASDFASDFADSF
#    consumer_secret=QWERTQWERTQWERT
# 4) manually run this shell script typing ./commands/twitter
#    An url will be given an a PIN should be asked, the PIN is found behind
#    the url.
# 5) Once the pin given, the script will give you an access_token_key and an
#    access_token_secret, write them near to the consumer_key and
#    consumer_secret in the bti.conf file.
